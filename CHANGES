CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1

  o Thank you to C. Lepoittevin and K. Fijorek who pointed out a misuse of 'ifelse' in the function 'hsm'. 
  This has been corrected, so now 'hsm' works correctly. 
  o Functions fiskMode, gompertzMode, koenkerMode, kumarMode, laplaceMode, paralogisticMode, paretoMode, rayleighMode are added. 
  o Function symstbMode is removed. 
  o Package modeest now needs to load 'stabledist' and 'VGAM' (in addition to 'stats', 'evd', and 'fBasics'). 
  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.09

  o The Asselin de Beauville mode estimator has been added. 
  o A function 'as.numeric.mlv' is provided. 
  o Methods for the Chernoff distribution are provisionally suppressed, because 
  of their lack of efficiency. 
  o The DIP statistic is no longer provided. 
  o In function 'tsybakov', the argument 'djeddour' is renamed 'dmp'. 
  o In functions 'parzen' and 'mlv.density', the argument 'biau' is renamed 'abc'.
